Create a Button component that will render a <button>...</button> element with the following specifications:

It should render the text it receives. <Button>Hello</Button> should render Hello in between the <button> tags.

It should always have the class 'btn' which is used for giving the button its style.
add a basic .btn class in your css.

In addition to the class btn, it should als have the class "btn-outline" when the outline prop is received. Otherwise, it should have the class "btn-default". One of these classes should be added, but not both.
create both classes in your css to check if everything works fine.

The user is able to add their own classes. For example, <Button className="extra-class" /> will render <button className="btn btn-default extra-class"/>. Test this out by creating that custom class.

The button should be customizable/extendable. Whatever prop the user pass should also be rendered on the <button /> element. For example (but not limited to), onClick, disabled, type, etc.
