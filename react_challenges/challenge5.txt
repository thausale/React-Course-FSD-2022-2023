Create a Input component that will render a <input /> element with the following specifications:

It should render the following HTML:
<label class="label">
  Text box name here
  <span class="input-required">*</span>
  <div>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Text box name here" />
  </div>
</label>

Replace 'Text box name here' (both entries) with the placeholder prop that the <Input /> component receives.

It should default to type="text" when the user does not provide a type prop. So <Input /> would render an <input type="text" /> and <Input type="email" /> would render an <input type="email" />.

The <input /> should always have the class input but can also be extended with whatever class the user provides.
Create the .input class in your css to test this out.

The <span class="input-required">*</span> should only be rendered when the <Input /> receives a required prop.
Create the .input-required class in your css to test this out.

When the <Input /> receives a required prop, it should render <input required />

The <input /> should receive all remaining props defined by the user. This will allow the onInput event to work for example. As well as disabling the input or marking it as readonly.
